mrspec
======

Minitest and RSpec, sitting in a tree...

Runs Minitest tests using RSpec's runner.
Also runs RSpec's tests, so if you want to use them side-by-side,
this will do it.


Examples
--------

* [Autoloads specs and tests](https://github.com/JoshCheek/dotfiles/blob/7495046fbe4a927394558e7da43b07219b02594f/test/mrspec.feature#L9)
* [Fail fast](https://github.com/JoshCheek/dotfiles/blob/7495046fbe4a927394558e7da43b07219b02594f/test/mrspec.feature#L109)
* [Tagging tests](https://github.com/JoshCheek/dotfiles/blob/7495046fbe4a927394558e7da43b07219b02594f/test/mrspec.feature#L181)
* [Tagging classes](https://github.com/JoshCheek/dotfiles/blob/4c5bf2948a5f1d850e9d33311d1bea139e80c7ba/test/mrspec.feature#L240)


Why?
----

That rakefile thing is bullshit.
(find that rant I wrote)
(both the RSpec one, and the Minitest one just shell out anyway)
(I shouldn't need to add a dep on Rake just to have it call a method)
(difficulty getting minitest to run just the ones I want)


Nuances
-------

Changes the default pattern to look for any files suffixed with `_test.rb` or `_spec.rb`, or prefixed with `test_`
(RSpec, by itself, only looks for suffixes of `_spec.rb`).

Changes the default search directories to be `test` and `spec`
(RSpec, by itself, only looks in `spec`).

Turns off monkey patching, so you cannot use RSPec's toplevel describe, or `should`.
There are 2 reasons for this:

1. It conflicts with `Minitest::Spec`'s definition of `Kernel#describe`
   ([here](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest/blob/f1081566ec6e9e391628bde3a26fb057ad2576a8/lib/minitest/spec.rb#L71)).
   And must be preemptively turned off, because after-the-fact disabling
   causes it to be undefined on both `main` and `Module` ([here](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/blob/3145e2544e1825bc754d0986e893664afe19abf5/lib/rspec/core/dsl.rb#L72)),
   which means that even if you don't use it, it will still interfere with `Minitest::Spec`
   (removing methods allows method lookup to find superclass definitions,
   but undefining them ends method lookup.)
2. You should just not do that in general. Monkey patching is a bad plan, all around,
   just use the namespaced methods, or create your own methods to wrap the assertion syntax.
   I'm looking forward to when this feature is removed altogether.


Running the tests
-----------------

```sh
$ bundle
$ bundle exec cucumber
```
