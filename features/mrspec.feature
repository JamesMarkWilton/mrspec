Feature: mrspec
  Minitest doesn't have a runner, but a runner would be really nice.
  RSpec has a nice runner... so lets join them together!

  Background:
    # stupid hacky solution to reset proving grounds instead of working in subdirs :/
    Given I run 'ruby -e "puts Dir[%(**/*_{spec,test}.rb)]" | xargs rm'


  Scenario: Finds spec/**/*_spec.rb and test/**/*_test.rb and test/**/test_*.rb
    Given the file "spec/a_spec.rb":
    """
